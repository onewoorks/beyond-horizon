The inspection was executed by Beyond Horizon Technologies Sdn. Bhd. on 28th September 2018. The various tasks comprising the inspection of this structure were executed by Remote Operated Aerial Vehicle (ROAV) BHTech M210 Multicopter. The BHTech M210 Multicopter is equipped with the latest ROAV technology and carry a high definition camera with 30x Optical remote zoom. The objective of the inspection was to assess the existing condition in order to provide data for future maintenance. A team of consisting of 1 experience ROAV pilot and 1 experience welding inspector was mobilized to D35, D35PG-A to conduct this aerial inspection.
